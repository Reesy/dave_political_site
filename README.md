1. Stopping the Tax Increases & Demanding Fiscal Responsibility:
* Held the Line on Taxes: I would have voted NO on the recent 1.25% tax increase pushed by the current board, unlike my opponent. Protecting your wallet is my top priority.
* Put Surplus Funds Back to Work for Taxpayers: Lee College has surplus funds. Instead of letting it sit or funding pet projects, I'll push to explore using that money for direct tax relief for Baytown property owners.
* Smart Revenue Generation, Not Higher Taxes: We can increase revenue without hitting your pocketbook. My plan includes attracting more international students who pay significantly higher tuition, bringing in outside money to support the college and ease the burden on local taxpayers. My unique background (speaking Japanese) can directly help achieve this.
* Cut Wasteful Spending: As your representative, I will be a fiscal watchdog, scrutinizing every dollar spent to ensure it directly benefits students' practical education or essential college functions – not unnecessary administrative bloat.

2. Real Accountability: Shining a Light on How Your Money is Spent:
* End Secret Meetings: Demand all board meetings and important committee meetings are recorded and easily available online. No more decisions made behind closed doors – you deserve to see exactly how your tax dollars are being managed.
* Establish Strong Ethics Oversight: It's unacceptable that there's no ethics committee. I will demand one be created immediately to ensure board members are held to the highest standards of conduct and fiscal integrity.
* Taxpayer Oversight on Committees: I believe taxpayers should have a seat at the table. I'll advocate for adding community members, like you, to key college committees to provide direct oversight.
* Proven Track Record of Protecting Taxpayers: I don't just talk about accountability; I achieve it. I fought City Hall for years to reinstate their ethics commission. My advocacy directly led to recovering $3.25 million for taxpayers from the flawed San Jacinto Mall deal – even the developers acknowledged my effectiveness in protecting your interests.

3. Focusing Education on Practical Skills & Workforce Readiness:
* Ensure Value for Students (and Taxpayers): We need to know exactly where money for "student services" is going. Spending on students has barely been measured, and what we know (only 4% previously) is concerning. I'll demand transparency and ensure funds support practical needs, not frivolous activities.
* Demand Fairness – No Free Rides: Impact students use campus facilities just like traditional students. It's only fair they contribute to the student service fee. Everyone benefiting should contribute their fair share.
* Prioritize Job Skills & Trades: While traditional academics are important, Lee College must focus intensely on career training, technical education, and partnerships with local industries (like Exxon, Covestro) to ensure graduates have valuable, employable skills right here in Baytown.
* Promote Self-Reliance Through Entrepreneurship: Support programs that teach students how to build their own businesses, fostering independence and contributing to our local economy.

4. Experienced, No-Nonsense Leadership for Baytown:
* Business Owner Sensibility: I own my own business. I understand budgets, efficiency, and the bottom line – skills desperately needed on the Lee College board.
* Deep Local Roots & Proven Advocate: I'm a Lee College graduate and a long-time, active community advocate who consistently shows up and speaks out for taxpayers at city and college meetings. I know this community and I fight for it.
* In Touch with Reality: We need board members grounded in today's world, who understand efficiency and effective communication, not incumbents who are out of touch. My opponent didn't even have a basic campaign presence online until now.
* Trusted by Diverse Voices: My track record has earned endorsements and respect from leaders across the political spectrum, proving I can work effectively to get results for Baytown.

Vote David Isaac: Your Fiscal Watchdog for Lee College. Let's Bring Common Sense, Accountability, and Taxpayer Protection Back to the Board.
